### About

Don't know what to draw? Is your roommate tired of you bugging them for drawing ideas? Here is an extremely limited set of options, fresh off the `Math.rand()` permutation express. If you want more options, add 'em.

### Usage

First, you need node in your life.

- Clone down, navigate to root directory
- Run `node whatShouldIDraw.js`
- Draw it, or try again. (or don't, I'm not your mom)
